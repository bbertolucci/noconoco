# noconoco
Nononoco was a free android interface for the vod streaming service of Nolife (https://www.nolife-tv.com/) whose name was Noco.

Nolife was a french tv channel dedicated to japanese culture and video game. More details here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolife_(TV_channel)

But due to termination of service the application can't be used with production service since end of June 2018 - So the last version is a demo version for this source code.

This source code was uploaded with a "demo" version (offline version). There is no server left, and no server code left (that's a shame!)... so all the results of API call are simulated but all the images and contents are randomized - so all filter and sort are not working. Favorites and Playlist also are not working.

This application was developped exclusively for Android and can be a good exemple (I hope) for VOD application.

Contents :

Grid or column thumbs with scrolling and autopaging. All the images are cached with asynchronous loading.

There is a navigation drawer and tabs can be added to a menu tab with autocentering.
